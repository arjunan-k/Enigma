# Enigma

After watching the biopic of Alan Turing (The Imitation Game), got inspired by the Enigma machine working priciple and made a Mini and mine version of that Machine.

In this program I have used Morse code as a cipher to encrypt and decrypt the messages. Here we will be able to convert our text messages into Morse code and vice versa.

Another feature of the program is generating sound corresponding to the morse code symbol. Just like a morse code converter it converts the symbols into sounds. For clarification I just added the the symbol name as sound itself.
